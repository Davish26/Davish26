        "2. When i first saw the question, i tried to work it based on my knowledge but it was not possible as it was the first time i was working on this module. I learned about it and found out that i had to install it first as it was not working only by importing. With the help of different websites, i found a lot of useful information which helped me in building the program part by part. So, i installed the module newpaper3k and imported Article from newpaper in order to extract the article details. The first function is used to return the articles url, title and its text. Additionally, the second function article_summary, checks if there is a mistake in the url and provides us with an error message incase there is an error. Then we have the url list which passes through the loop which will check and extract information for all the urls that has been input in the list.\n",
        "3. As it is seen above, in order to handle such as errors, i added an exception part which will tell us when there are errors in the url\n",

        "Title: ‘We can rebuild’: Ukrainian mayor sees opportunity amid dam chaos\n",
        "Text: Andrii Seletskyi stands on what was, until Tuesday morning, the bank of the Dnipro River and looks out at the water, continously receding. The young mayor’s town is 60 miles (97km) north-east and upstream of the now ruined Nova Kakhovka dam, and he does not know where the riverwaters will finally settle.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a prospect that would prompt many to despair. But not Seletskyi, even though last week’s events will bring a dramatic change in the geography and hydrology of his town, Novovorontsovka. As a student of history, he has been thinking ahead and sees opportunity amid the chaos.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In depth, the water has gone out over five metres; in width it is going out about 50 to 70 centimetres an hour,” the mayor says, standing on the old riverbank as the falling levels leave behind a bed of silty mud and a dominating musty, rotten smell. “It would be far worse if it was warmer,” he adds; the temperature has dropped about 10 degrees today and a rain storm sweeps in.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his office Seletskyi explains further. “We don’t know where the water will stop,” he begins, but then he heads to the wall and the past to offer a prediction. “In 2020, we started a project of local history, and we bought from the United States aerial photographs taken by the Luftwaffe in 1943.” These showed the topography of the region before Nova Kakhovka was completed in 1956.\n",
        "\n",
        "He started the project because he believed “there would be an emergency or explosion and the dam could be damaged”, but says no one took him very seriously. The regional governor in Kherson was completely dismissive until after the disaster, says Seletskyi. “He called up and said: ‘Can you show me those plans again?’”\n",

        "\n",
        "Before the dam was completed, there were a series of smaller rivers lying in a floodplain, the nearest of which was the Bystryk. Its banks were 1km away from Novovorontsovka, Seletskyi says, pointing out the distance on the wartime photograph. The retreat of the Dnipro will require the town to find other water sources, he says, as he does not expect the dam to be rebuilt.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no immediate water crisis, fortunately, but to ensure a sustained long-term supply, engineers will have to complete pumping works on two remaining usable wells before an existing reservoir runs dry – assuming, that is, the town can get the money its needs to complete the work. Money has been promised by Kyiv but the project could take six months or more, Seletskyi says.\n",
        "\n",
        "Complicating the picture further is the fact that the water infrastructure and Novovorontsovka remain in range of Russian guns across the river. Fear is as much of a problem as the danger of enemy shelling. “The day before yesterday, workers trying to repair water pipes evacuated a couple of times because they thought that river gulls flying towards them were Russian drones,” Seletskyi says.\n",

        "Soldiers walk along what was part of the Dnipro River at Novovorontsovka in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian\n",
        "\n",
        "Mines from the current war and even old explosives from the second world war remain a danger – specialist teams have been deployed five times so far to tackle contemporary and historic weaponry. The Dnipro was scene of a vast battle in late 1943, and military helmets and skulls, thought to be from that time, have ghoulishly appeared on the surface of the mud left be the receding waters.\n",

        "\n",
        "Seletskyi hopes it may be possible to create a local museum of all the objects rapidly being uncovered. “We have a unique opportunity to dive into our history,” he says – and a duty to ensure that people do not steal or sell the artefacts that are revealed. He picks up a pair of mud-encrusted silver spoons “from the tsarist time” and a large key that looks like it could open a pirate’s chest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimism under the circumstances is remarkable. “Of course we can rebuild,” says Seletskyi. “We have precedents in history. There are countries like Germany that were 90% destroyed after the war. They restored everything. I love my land and my home town, and I have this feeling of collective responsibility”\n",

        "Title: Sweden players had to show their genitalia at 2011 Women’s World Cup, says Nilla Fischer\n",
        "Text: Sweden’s players had to “show their genitalia for the doctor” at the 2011 Women’s World Cup to prove they were women, the team’s centre-back Nilla Fischer has revealed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In her new book – I Didn’t Even Say Half Of It – Fischer, who played 194 times for her country, described the process, which was conducted by a female physiotherapist on behalf of the doctor, as humiliating.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gender tests were carried out around the 2011 tournament in Germany after protests from Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana relating to allegations that the Equatorial Guinea squad included men.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We were told that we should not shave ‘down there’ in the coming days and that we will show our genetalia for the doctor,” Fischer writes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No one understands the thing about shaving but we do as we are told and think ‘how did it get to this?’ Why are we forced to do this now, there has to be other ways to do this. Should we refuse?\n",
        "\n",
        "“At the same time no one wants to jeopardise the opportunity to play at a World Cup. We just have to get the shit done no matter how sick and humiliating it feels.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In an interview with the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Fischer detailed the process in more depth. “I understand what I have to do and quickly pull down my training pants and underwear at the same time,” she said. “The physio nods and says ‘yup’ and then looks out at the doctor who is standing with his back to my doorway. He makes a note and moves on in the corridor to knock on the next door.\n",
        "\n",
        "“When everyone on our team is checked, that is to say, has exposed their vagina, our team doctor can sign that the Swedish women’s national football team consists only of women.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Asked how it felt, Fischer said: “We had a very safe environment in the team. So it was probably the best environment to do it in. But it’s an extremely strange situation and overall not a comfortable way to do it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Two weeks before the 2011 World Cup began, Fifa issued its current gender recognition policies, which require teams to sign a declaration guaranteeing that players chosen for the World Cup are “of an appropriate gender”. Those rules state that: “It lies with each participating member association to … ensure the correct gender of all players by actively investigating any perceived deviation in secondary sex characteristic.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It is unclear why Sweden’s players were given a physical exam when a buccal swab test – a cheap and non-intrusive way to collect DNA from the cells on the inside of the cheek and determine a person’s sex – has been used widely for decades.\n",

        "Sweden’s team doctor in 2011, Mats Börjesson, said the tests took place after Fifa demanded immediate testing when rumours began circulating about Equatorial Guinea’s team.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Fifa doesn’t do this to be mean to anyone,” he said. “The sports world has tried to create fairness for girls so that they don’t train their whole lives and then someone comes in with an unreasonable advantage.”\n",
