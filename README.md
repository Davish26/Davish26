- The purpose of this assignment was to analyse the emails and to read the different set of tables available in the data set. Also, it helped us to gain more knowledge on how we could make better programs by doing researches. Additionally, we had to look for set of datas in the database and create grapghs, barcharts and piechartby importing libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib and converting the data into dataframes using pandas. 
- The purpose of the repository is to manage and save our programming codes where different people could work together. Moreover, it enables the facilitation of communication with our team mates in order to manage projects and get feedbacks from others also.
